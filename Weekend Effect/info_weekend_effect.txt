Play 1 : manipulation of just days of the week. I wrote a function that converts any date into a day of the week from 0 to 6 (monday to sunday)
Play 2 : apparently I didn't save it and lost all of my analysis techniques - tragic but its pretty much redone in Play 5
Play 3 : Failed attempt to compare diagnoses to procedures
Play 4 : Tallies out numbers of diagnoses for certain diseases, can probably be improved to be more specific
Play 5 : Tons of analysis techniques that I manipulated to work for our data
